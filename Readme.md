This project aims at Implementing Reinforcement Learning by gaming.
We are gonna build an AI model specifically a reinforcement learning model to be able to play mario to see the back and forth as we go and build up this model.

We are going to run this in python language. We're going to be using open ai gym.This is a common framework that makes it easy to train ai to play games
and interact with other simulated environments think alphago but on a smaller scale for our mission we are using gym super mario brothers environment that's
been built - "https://pypi.org/project/gym-super-mario-bros/" on top of the NES emulator for python.
